# Release It - Containerized

This project is a containerized version of [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it). The purpose of this project is to enable release-it to run in any environment as a standardized container without the need for a Node environment.

This project is simply a wrapper to run as containerization of release-it and execute release-it directly, providing the environment and setup around to run it.

## Acknowledgment

This project is only possible due to the existence of [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) and all its contributors for the great work.
